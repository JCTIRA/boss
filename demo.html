    <h1>Passionfruit Lyrics</h1>
    <h4>Song by Drake</h4>
   
    <p>Hold on, hold on, fuck that</p>
    <p>Fuck that shit</p>
    <p>Hold on, I got to start this motherfuckin' record over again</p>
    <p>Wait a minute</p>
    <p>Fuck that shit</p>
    <p>Still on this motherfuckin' record</p>
    <p>I'ma play this motherfucka for y'all</p>
    <p>Ayy, y'all get some more drinks goin' on</p>
    <p>I'll sound a whole lot better</p>
  
    <h2>[Verse 1]</h2>
    <p>Listen</p>
    <p>Seeing you got ritualistic</p>
    <p>Cleansin' my soul of addiction for now</p>
    <p>'Cause I'm fallin' apart</p>
    <p>Yeah, tension</p>
    <p>Between us just like picket fences</p>
    <p>You got issues that I won't mention for now</p>
    <p>'Cause we're fallin' apart</p>
    
    <h2>[Chorus]</h2>
    <p>Passionate from miles away</p>
    <p>Passive with the things you say</p>
    <p>Passin' up on my old ways</p>
    <p>I can't blame you, no, no</p>
    <p>Passionate from miles away</p>
    <p>Passive with the things you say</p>
    <p>Passin' up on my old ways</p>
    <p>I can't blame you, no, no</p>
    
    <h2>[Verse 2]</h2>
    <p>Listen</p>
    <p>Harder buildin' trust from a distance</p>
    <p>I think we should rule out commitment for now</p>
    <p>Cause we're fallin' apart</p>
    <p>Leavin'</p>
    <p>You're just doing that to get even</p>
    <p>Don't pick up the pieces, just leave it for now</p>
    <p>They keep fallin' apart</p>
    
    <h2>[Chorus]</h2>
    <p>Passionate from miles away</p>
    <p>Passive with the things you say</p>
    <p>Passin' up on my old ways</p>
    <p>I can't blame you, no, no</p>
    <p>Passionate from miles away</p>
    <p>Passive with the things you say</p>
    <p>Passin' up on my old ways</p>
    <p>I can't blame you, no, no</p>
